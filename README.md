# About this project
1. A simple E-Commerce app made with Redux Toolkit and firebase as backend.
2. You can add/remove items to/from cart and wishlist.
3. You can move items from cart to wishlist.
4. You can change quantity of specific items.
5. It will automatically update total number of items and total cart price.
6. Items added in cart or wishlist will be highlighted in the home page.
7. If an item already exists in cart or wishlist, it cannot be re-added.
8. You can checkout your cart. This will simulate placing an order and your cart will be cleared automatically.
9. Cart or wishlist data is not lost when page is refreshed. Local storage is used to store data.

# Future updates
1. Authentication can be implemented in future and after that, cart or wishlist data can be stored as per user accounts.
2. Order history option can also be implemented once authentication is set up.

# Improvements
1. It is not 100% responsive yet. Will work fine on mobile devices. For best experience, use it on desktops or laptops.
